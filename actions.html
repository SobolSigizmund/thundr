	<h2>Routes</h2>
	
	<p>
		Incoming web requests are handled by thundr using <em>routes</em>.
	</p>
	<p>
		A route is a url wildcard pattern which maps to an <em>action</em>.
		Each route is of a http request type - <em>GET</em>, <em>PUT</em>, <em>POST</em> or <em>DELETE</em>. 
	</p>
	<p>
		By default routes are loaded from the resource file <code>routes.json</code>.
		Within this file, routes are defined as a json structure.
	</p>
<pre>
{
	"/" 		: "au.com.threewks.thundrweb.Controller.home"
	"/form/" 	: {
				"GET" 	: "au.com.threewks.thundrweb.Controller.getForm",
				"POST" 	: "au.com.threewks.thundrweb.Controller.postForm",
			},
	"/view/{id}"	: "au.com.threewks.thundrweb.Controller.view"
}
</pre>
	<p>
		Routes can map to different types of actions. The most common action is <code>MethodAction</code>, which will
		result in a method being invoked on a <a href="/controllers.html">controller</a>.
	</p> 
	<p>
		In the above example, requests to the base url '/' will be processed by the <i>home</i> method defined in the <i>Controller</i> class.<br/>
		GET Requests on '/form/' will be processed by <i>getForm()</i> and POSTs will be processed by <i>postForm()</i>.<br/>
		Finally, requests matching the path '/view/*' will be processed by the method with the name <i>view</i>, with the addition that the
		value matching the wildcard can be passed as a parameter with the name 'id', permitting <i>view(String id)</i>.			
	</p>

	<h4><code>Actions</code></h4>
	<p class="actions">
		Each route maps to a single <code>Action</code>. Actions determine how your application handles a web request. 
		In general, an action will usually result in some code being invoked, but other types of actions exist.
	</p>
	<p>
		Currently thundr supports the following actions out of the box:

<section id="actionResolver">
	<h4><code>ActionResolver</code> <span class="label label-info">Advanced</span></h4>
	<p>
		Each type of action is handled by an <code>ActionResolver</code>. 
		ActionResolvers process an Action when a route is requested. You can create and configure custom Action and ActionResolvers 
		to handle routes, although in general this is not necessary. 
	</p>
	<div>
		An action resolver has two responsibilities:
		<ul>
			<li>creating an <code>Action</code> for a route if it can process that route, and</li>
			<li>resolving an action it created when a route is requested by an http client</li>
		</ul> 
	</div>
	<p>
		Action resolution usually involves binding data based on route configuration and request parameters, and serving up
		response content and http response codes. This is done using the standard Java Servlet interfaces, <code>HttpServletRequest</code> and <code>HttpServletResponse</code>
	</p>
	<p>
		If you wish to register a custom Action and ActionResolver, you can invoke the method
		<code>
		<pre>Routes.addActionResolver(Class&lt;A&gt; actionType, ActionResolver&lt;A&gt; actionResolver);</pre>
		</code>
		This needs to be done before the routes are loaded. The <code>Routes</code> object is available in the <code>InjectionConfiguration</code> during 
		startup.
