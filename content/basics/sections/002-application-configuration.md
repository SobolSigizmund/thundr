#### Application Configuration

Beyond the basics of controller invocation and returning a view, there are several elements of configuration required for a thundr based application.

- [web.xml](#webXml) - configuring the thundr servlet
- [modules.properties](#modulesProperties) - defining the thundr modules in use
- [InjectionConfiguation](#injectionConfiguration) - your dependency injection configuration
- [application properties](#applicationProperties) - your environmental properties
