	<p>
		thundr has framework support for sending of emails. 
		To send an email, you use the fluent api returned from the <code>Mailer.mail(HttpServletRequest req)</code> method. 
	</p>
	<p>
		The <code>MailBuilder</code> returned from this method has a variety of email specific properties you can set. In addition, 
		you specify the body of the email using the standard <code>View</code> framework of thundr. That is, you can provide
		the body of the email using anything you could render a <a href="/views.html">view</a> with.

<section id="limitations">
	<h4>Limitations</h4>
	<p>
		thundr mail is build on top of the standard <code>javax.mail</code> api. If your target platform cannot send email using this api,
		or if it requires additional configuration you will need to configure this yourself.
	</p>
	<p>
		Currently thundr mail only supports basic html emails. It does not create multipart mails,
		and does not support embedded conten, such as cid references and attachments.
